        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino and Parmesan. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the pork, and sauté until the fat just renders, on the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just before pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in skillet, if needed. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino and pepper.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Add 2 tablespoons salt, cover and bring to a boil over high.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Uncover, lower the heat to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are very tender when pierced with a small paring knife, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Meanwhile, cut the butter in 1/2-inch dice and put it back in the refrigerator.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After the potatoes are drained, pour the milk into a small saucepan and heat over low just until it simmers. Turn off the heat.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Place a food mill fitted with the finest blade on top of the large saucepan. Process the potatoes into the pan. (Alternately, use a ricer or potato masher, making sure the potatoes are very smooth before proceeding.)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> With the heat on low, vigorously whisk the cold butter into the potatoes several bits at a time, waiting for each addition to be incorporated before adding more butter.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Once all the butter has been integrated, slowly whisk in enough of the hot milk to make the potatoes the desired consistency, creamy but still thick. Add 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Whisk in the lemon zest, reserving some for garnish, if desired. Season to taste, and serve hot. Sprinkle with reserved lemon zest just before serving.

        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
